# Django_Starter_Code
Note: This is not code that can easily be cloned and run on a local machine as it has many dependencies and specifics

Start your own Django project
```bash
pipenv install django
pipenv shell
django-admin startproject project_name .
```

# Usage
This codebase can help beginners understand how Django works with static files as well as how to use bootstrapCDN 

Django also highly recommends using a custom user model for new projects. This code will show you how that's done

Finally, the starter code builds a simple user authentication with a Signup and Login page. 

# 3rd Party 
Django projects can use many great 3rd party programs. For this project, I used a app called crispy-forms which styles Django forms!
```bash
pipenv install django-crispy-forms
```
